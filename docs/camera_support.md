# Camera Support

**Available in: Extended firmware only**

The extended firmware includes hardware-accelerated camera support with WebRTC streaming.

## Features

- Hardware-accelerated camera stack (Rockchip MPP/VPU) with WebRTC streaming
- MIPI CSI internal camera and USB camera support
- Low-latency WebRTC streaming (best quality and performance)
- Hot-plug detection for USB cameras
- Web-based camera controls with settings persistence
- Optional RTSP streaming support
- Compatible with AI detection and Snapmaker Cloud features

## Accessing Cameras

### Internal Camera

Access at: `http://<printer-ip>/webcam/`

The internal camera is automatically configured and enabled.

### USB Camera

Access at: `http://<printer-ip>/webcam2/`

USB cameras must be enabled in `extended2.cfg`. See [USB Camera Configuration](#usb-camera-configuration) below for setup instructions.

## Moonraker Camera Configuration

Camera streaming settings are configured through Moonraker configuration files in the `extended/moonraker/` directory.

### Internal Camera Configuration

Edit `extended/moonraker/02_internal_camera.cfg` to customize internal camera streaming:

```cfg
[webcam case]
service: webrtc-camerastreamer
stream_url: /webcam/webrtc
snapshot_url: /webcam/snapshot.jpg
aspect_ratio: 16:9
```

**Available streaming modes:**
- `webrtc-camerastreamer` - WebRTC streaming (best quality and performance, default)
  - `stream_url: /webcam/webrtc`
- `iframe` - H264/MJPEG iframe streaming (acceptable quality and performance)
  - `stream_url: /webcam/player`
- `mjpegstreamer-adaptive` - MJPEG streaming (best compatibility, most resource intensive)
  - No stream_url needed (uses snapshot_url only)

### USB Camera Configuration

Edit `extended/moonraker/03_usb_camera.cfg` to enable USB camera. Uncomment one of the sections:

```cfg
[webcam usb]
service: webrtc-camerastreamer
stream_url: /webcam2/webrtc
snapshot_url: /webcam2/snapshot.jpg
aspect_ratio: 16:9
```

**Important:** Only one streaming mode can be active per camera. After changing camera configuration, reboot the printer.

## Camera Controls

**Note: Camera controls and RTSP streaming are only available with the paxx12 camera service.**

The paxx12 camera service includes a web-based interface for adjusting camera settings in real-time. Available controls depend on your camera hardware capabilities.

### Accessing Camera Controls

Camera controls are accessible at:
- Internal camera: `http://<printer-ip>/webcam/control`
- USB camera: `http://<printer-ip>/webcam2/control`

### Settings Persistence

Camera settings are automatically saved across reboots:
- Internal camera: `/oem/printer_data/config/extended/camera/case.json`
- USB camera: `/oem/printer_data/config/extended/camera/usb.json`

To reset camera settings to defaults, delete the corresponding JSON file and reboot the printer.

## Configuration

All camera configuration is done through `/home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/extended2.cfg`. See [Firmware Configuration](firmware_config.md) for editing instructions.

### Internal Camera Selection

By default, the extended firmware uses a custom hardware-accelerated camera service (paxx12). To switch to Snapmaker's original camera service:

```ini
[camera]
internal: snapmaker
```

To disable the internal camera entirely (also disables timelapses):

```ini
[camera]
internal: none
```

Note: Only one camera service can be operational at a time for the internal camera.

### Camera Logging

Enable logging to syslog for all camera services:

```ini
[camera]
logs: syslog
```

Logs are available in `/var/log/messages`.

### RTSP Streaming

RTSP streaming is disabled by default (paxx12 service only). To enable:

```ini
[camera]
rtsp: true
```

RTSP streams will be available at:
- Internal camera: `rtsp://<printer-ip>:8554/stream`
- USB camera: `rtsp://<printer-ip>:8555/stream`

### USB Camera Configuration

Enable USB camera support (paxx12 service only):

```ini
[camera]
usb: paxx12
```

To disable USB camera:

```ini
[camera]
usb: none
```

When enabled, USB cameras are accessible at `http://<printer-ip>/webcam2/`.

After any configuration changes, reboot the printer for changes to take effect.

## Timelapse Support

Fluidd timelapse plugin is included. Timelapse recording is enabled by default for every print -- no manual toggle needed.

To check or change the timelapse setting via the Moonraker API:

```bash
# Check current setting
curl http://localhost:7125/machine/timelapse/settings

# Disable for the current session
curl -X POST http://localhost:7125/machine/timelapse/settings \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"enabled": false}'
```

The setting resets to `enabled: true` on each Moonraker restart. To permanently disable timelapse, set `internal: none` in the `[camera]` section of `extended2.cfg`.

## Print Photo Capture

A photo of each finished print is automatically captured and saved for use in scripted workflows (e.g. automated listings). The photo also replaces the gcode file's touchscreen thumbnail.

See [Print Photo Capture](print_photo.md) for full details, output paths, and scripting examples.
